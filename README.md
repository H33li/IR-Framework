# Cybersecurity Incident Response Framework

This repository contains a project we worked on as a graduation project of ***Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)***, it was to build a **Cybersecurity Incident Response Framework**. The framework is designed to guide organizations through the process of planning for, responding to, and learning from cybersecurity incidents in a structured way.

## What This Project Covers
The framework focuses on:
- **Preparation**: Developing plans, improving system security, and setting up preventive measures.
- **Incident Response**: Handling incidents effectively by following clear steps for containment, eradication, and recovery.
- **Review**: Documenting and analyzing incidents to improve future responses.

## What’s Included
The key deliverable in this repository is:
- **Framework Document (PDF)**: A detailed document covering the framework, practical steps, and outcomes from applying it.

## Why This Matters
Cybersecurity incidents are increasingly common, and having a solid response plan can make all the difference. This framework aims to provide a clear, actionable approach to dealing with incidents, whether you’re new to cybersecurity or experienced in the field.
